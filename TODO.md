Notes for "next time".

## v2

* I need at least 5mm, maybe 10mm, more height, to fit some of my levers like the Nobi Bullet
* The panels' connection points could probably be a bit thinner to accommodate more bolts. A 20mm bolt barely clears the
  two panels and I don't like that kind of bolt connection.
* Engraving some cosmetic stuff? Or maybe a place to mount other plates?
