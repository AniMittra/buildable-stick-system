Notes for "next time".

## v3

* Check that the 24mm cutouts in the frame are good enough, somehow I didn't have them when I printed v2
* Engraving some cosmetic stuff? Or maybe a place to mount other plates?
* Try making it so top plates are bolted in from the side of the frame rather than the top
