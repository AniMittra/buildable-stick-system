Notes for "next time".

## v4

* Engraving some cosmetic stuff? Or maybe a place to mount other plates?
* Try making it so top plates are bolted in from the side of the frame rather than the top
    * I'm thinking of abandoning this, because it makes the frame more complicated to have a portion of a column rather
      than the full column, but I'll keep it here for a bit longer
* Try making frames out of four pieces connected at joints on the hex posts, rather than one large piece?
