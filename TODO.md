# TODO

Notes for "next time".

## v2

* I need at least 5mm, maybe 10mm, more height, to fit some of my levers like the Nobi Bullet
    * I couldn't even fit a JLF without the compensations in v1 on the bottom panel
    * I had to bend the pins a bit on Crown SDB-202s, too
* Top plates are 1-2mm too thick for snap-ins, maybe have a variant with a couple shaved off like with the bottom plate
  workaround
* The plates bow a bit on the top when pressure is applied, because there's no support from the frame up there ---
  adding 5mm to the frame should leave a couple mm for support to get added back
* PCB mount on `top-panel-dir_arc-plus-w-30mm-plus-one-with-mount.scad` doesn't leave room for a USB cable on the right
  hand side
* The panels' connection points could probably be a bit thinner to accommodate more bolts. A 20mm bolt barely clears the
  two panels and I don't like that kind of bolt connection.
* Engraving some cosmetic stuff? Or maybe a place to mount other plates?
