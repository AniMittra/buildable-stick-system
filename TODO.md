# TODO

Notes for "next time".

## v3

* Check that the 24mm cutouts in the frame are good enough, somehow I didn't have them when I printed v2
* Engraving some cosmetic stuff? Or maybe a place to mount other plates?

## v4

* Maybe add some 24mm buttons to the right panel now that there's more space?
* Try making it so top plates are bolted in from the side of the frame rather than the top
    * I'm thinking of abandoning this, because it makes the frame more complicated to have a portion of a column rather
      than the full column, but I'll keep it here for a bit longer
