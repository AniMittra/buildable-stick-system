# Materials

bss's random thoughts and notes on 3D printing materials.

## Bambu Lab PLA

### Basic

* In general, nice texture, but under direct light, you can see a bit of the infill pattern through the walls. Not super
  distracting, but it's there.

#### White

* Walls are practically translucent, you can almost always see the infill. Do not use for major components.
* Looks perfectly good for thin things like the Neutrik plates, decorative pieces, that kind of thing.

### Matte

* I don't like the texture as much, but they do produce nice non-primary color colorways, and you don't see the infill.
* Seems like their plastic treatment leaves some plate residue, so be better about cleaning it or you'll get ghosts.

## Hatchbox PLA

* Haven't done a lot of this yet, but my wife really likes the blue.
