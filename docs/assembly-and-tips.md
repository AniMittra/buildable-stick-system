Just some miscellaneous notes for any dear reader, or more likely, my own forgetful self.

## Removing Inset Panels

As of v4.1 (or in v3), the top and bottom inset panels both insert into the frame, inside the frame "lip", meaning that
when everything is put together, they create a flush surface (more or less). This can make them hard to get out, as you
can't grab anything to get any leverage, and especially with v4.1, the plastic posts to aid the friction fit make it
even harder to muscle out --- in fact, even if you could get an edge and start yanking, you'd probably just break some
of the plastic.

You can instead use the reverse side and the hex standoffs to push a panel out, as so:

1. Loosen, or completely remove, the hex bolts for the panel you would like to remove.
2. Flip the stick over, and remove the hex bolts on the opposite side.
3. Screw in longer bolts, or anything else that'll fit into the hole without going flush against the panel.
4. Push the long bolts in, thus pushing the standoffs, thus pushing the desired panel out from within.
5. You may have to even get a mallet and tap on a bolt, occasionally, as everything can be *pretty* tight.
